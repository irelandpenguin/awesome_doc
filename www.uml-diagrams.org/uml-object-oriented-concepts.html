<h1>Object-Oriented Design Concepts in UML</h1>

<p>
The <strong>Unified Modeling Language</strong>&trade; (<strong>UML</strong>&reg;) is inherently
 <strong>object-oriented modeling language</strong>
 and was designed for use in object-oriented software applications.
 The applications could be based on the <strong>object-oriented technologies</strong>
 recommended by the <strong>Object Management Group</strong> (OMG), which owns the UML. 
 The initial versions of UML (UML 1.x) were based on three leading object-oriented methods - Booch, OMT, and OOSE,
 to represent
 "<span class="citation">the culmination of best practices in practical object-oriented modeling</span>".
 UML 2.x is still object-oriented in its core (though there were some apparently unsuccessful attempts
 to extend UML to support other development methods).
</p>

<p>
Here's some illustration of this object orientation of UML from
<a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/references.html#ref-uml-142" class="external-ref" title="UML 1.4.2 Specification">UML 1.4.2 Specification</a>:
</p>
<p class="citation">
A frequently asked question has been: Why doesn’t UML support data-flow diagrams?
Simply put, data-flow and other diagram types that were not included in the UML do
not fit as cleanly into a consistent object-oriented paradigm.
</p>

<p>
This might explain why UML does not care for example to support <strong>database modeling</strong>,
 which is still mostly based on <strong>relational models</strong> to describe relational databases.
 It does not explain why UML ignores modeling of object relational databases or
 modeling of Graphical User Interfaces (GUI).
 GUI designs were and still are prominent examples of object-oriented design and programming,
 while completely neglected by UML.
</p>

<p>
To understand and use UML as intended by its authors, software architects and developers should be
 familiar with general concepts and methods of <strong>object-oriented analysis and design</strong>
 (<strong>OOAD</strong>) and/or 
 of the <strong>object-oriented development</strong> (<strong>OOD</strong>),
 and how those were applied to UML itself.
 There is one problem with this requirement: though OOAD/OOD is being used
 for several decades, there is still <strong>no concensus on what is OOAD</strong> and even what are
 the fundamental concepts ("quarks") of the OOAD.
 See one nice but pedantic attempt to define fundamental OOD concepts in  
 <a href="references.html#ref-quarks-ood" class="external-ref" 
 title="Deborah J. Armstrong, The Quarks of Object-Oriented Development.">[DJA 06]</a>.
</p>

<p>
A problem is that UML specification uses some OOD concepts assuming that there are some generally accepted 
 definitions of those concepts, which is a mistaken assumption.
 To make things even worse, the <strong>Glossary</strong>
 that was present in UML 1.x specifications and included terms from OMG standards
 and object-oriented analysis and design methods in addition to UML and MOF specific terminology,
 was <strong>removed</strong> from all UML 2.x specifications.
 Removing Glossary from UML specification was really wicked decision.
</p>

<p>
Ok, so we are really in trouble: UML specifications use OOAD concepts which have no clear and
 generally accepted definitions without providing own interpretations or definitions of those concepts.
 Wait, sometimes they do provide some definitions. Let's see what do we have.
</p>

<h2>Object-Oriented Design</h2>

<p>
Whether you agree or not, there is no commonly accepted definition of Object-Oriented Design
 (or Development, or Programming) (OOD, OOP).
 So I will make up some definition:
</p>

<p class="definition">
<strong>Object-Oriented Design</strong> is a software development approach to design and implement 
 software system as a collection of interacting stateful objects with specified structure and behavior.
</p>

<p>
There are several fundamental concepts defining OOD but there is no agreement on the exact list of the concepts,
 their definition and taxonomy (classification).
 We will take a look at some of OOD concepts that seem relevant to the UML:

*****************
  Class, Object
******************
-->

<h2 id="class-object">Class and Object</h2>

<p>
The origin of <strong>classes</strong> introduced in Simula 67 was computer <strong>simulation</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>classes</strong> in Simula 67 (called <strong>processes</strong> in Simula) 
  <a href="references.html#ref-sk-03" class="external-ref" title="Stein Krogdahl. The birth of Simula.">[SK 03]</a>,
 have a list of statements with execution started when object is created.
 When the execution of the statements ends, object becomes terminated.
 Object's local data and procedures can still be accessed from outside of the object after termination.
 During execution objects may choose to temporarily suspend their execution 
 (even if it is currently inside one or more procedure calls) and let another
 object to take control. If the control is later returned back to the object,
 it will resume execution from the point where it was suspended.
 For a Java or C# programmer this concept will sound like as a <strong>Thread</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Note, that the concept of the <strong>process</strong> in Simula was based on the <strong>block</strong>
 in Algol-60.
 Block in Algol-60 allowed declaration of local variables, local procedures and a list of executable statements.
 But execution of block could not be suspended, and once it is finished, local variables and procedures are
 removed from execution stack and no longer available.
</p>


<h3>Class and Object in UML</h3>

<p>
UML <strong>class</strong> is 
 a <a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/classifier.html" class="ref-link">classifier</a>
 which describes a set of objects that share the same
</p>
<ul type="circle">
<li><a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/uml-core.html#feature" class="ref-link">features</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/constraint.html" class="ref-link">constraints</a>,</li>
<li><strong>semantics (meaning)</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Class may be modeled as being <strong>active</strong>, meaning that 
 <a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/object.html" class="ref-link">an instance of the class</a>
 has some autonomous
 <a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/common-behaviors.html#behavior" class="ref-link">behavior</a>.
</p>

<p>
In all versions of UML from UML 1.x to UML 2.5, the essence of <strong>object</strong> is the same:
</p>

<p class="definition">
<strong>Object</strong> is an 
 <a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/uml-core.html#instance-core" class="ref-link">instance</a> of a
 <a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class.html" class="ref-link">class</a>.
</p>

<p>
Glossary of the now obsolete
 <a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/references.html#ref-uml-142" class="external-ref" title="UML 1.4.2 Specification">UML 1.4.2 Specification</a>
 defined object as 
</p>

<p class="definition">
An entity with a well defined boundary and identity that encapsulates state and behavior.
 State is represented by attributes and relationships, behavior is represented by operations,
 methods, and state machines. An object is an instance of a class. 
</p>

<p>
 <a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/references.html#ref-uml-25-b2" class="external-ref" title="UML 2.5 Specification RTF Beta 2">UML 2.5</a>
 describes object as 
</p>

<p class="definition">
An object is an individual [thing] with a state and relationships to other objects.
 The state of an object identifies the values for that object of properties of the classifier of the object.
</p>


<!--
*****************
     Message
******************
-->

<h2 id="message">Message</h2>

<p>
<strong>Message</strong> concept is probably one of the most confusing in OOAD, especially for
 the software developers familiar with modern messaging systems and APIs such as the Java Message Service (JMS)
 or Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ), which allow separate, uncoupled applications or components
 to reliably communicate asynchronously.
 Message concept in OOAD and UML is quite a different thing.
</p>

<p>
If we search language specifications of
 <strong>C++</strong>
 <a href="references.html#ref-bstr-cpp" class="external-ref" title="B. Stroustrup, The C++ Programming Language.">[BSC 77]</a>,
 <strong>Java</strong> <a href="references.html#ref-java-sp3" class="external-ref" 
 title="James Gosling et al., The Java Language Specification. 3rd Ed.">[JGJ 05]</a>, 
 or <strong>C#</strong> <a href="references.html#ref-csharp-sp4" class="external-ref" 
 title="C# Language Specification. Version 4.0.">[CSH 10]</a>
 - there is no concept of <strong>message</strong>.
 So let's travel back in time to
 <strong>Smalltalk</strong> <a href="references.html#ref-smalltalk-80" class="external-ref" 
 title="A. Goldberg and D. Robson. Smalltalk-80: The Language and its Implementation.">[A. Goldberg and D. Robson. Smalltalk-80: The Language and its Implementation.]</a>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Messages</strong> in Smalltalk-80 represent two-way communications between the objects of the system.
 Note, that "in Smalltalk everything is an object", including primitive values and classes.
 A message requests an operation from the receiver.
 Object selector and arguments transmit information to the receiver about what type of response to make.
 It is up to the receiver to decide how to respond to the message.
 The receiver returns an object back that becomes the value of the message expression.
</p> 

<p>
Let's consider simple Smalltalk example of a binary message to request arithmetic operation:
</p>
<div class="code-example">
3 + 4
</div>
<p>
 In this case, object '3' is the <strong>receiver</strong> of the <strong>message</strong> '+ 4'.
 The message contains <strong>selector</strong> '+' and <strong>argument</strong> '4'.
 Selector of the message is a name (or symbol) for the type of interaction required from the receiver.
 The receiver of the message ('3') returns back an object ('7') that becomes the value of the message expression.
</p>

<p>
 If a message expression includes an assignment prefix, the object returned by the receiver will become
 the new object referred to by the variable.
 Even if no information needs to be communicated back to the sender, a receiver always returns a value
 for the message expression.
 Returning a value indicates that the response to the message is complete. For example,
</p>
<div class="code-example">
sum &#x2190; 3 + 4
</div>
<p>
makes 7 to be the new value of the variable sum.
</p>


<h3>Object Creation Message</h3>

<p>
<strong>Classes</strong> are components of the Smalltalk-80 system, and they are represented
 by the <strong>objects</strong> as all other components.
 Each class has a name that describes the type of component its instances represent.
 A class name is a way for instances to identify themselves, and it provides a way
 to refer to the class in expressions.
 Class name becomes the name of a globally shared variable, and it must be capitalized.
</p>

<p>
<strong>New objects</strong> in Smalltalk-80 are created by sending messages <strong>to classes</strong>.
 Note, this approach resolves the dilemma of sending create message to nonexisting object to create itself.
 In Smalltalk the message is actually sent to the class object to create an instance of the class.
 Most classes respond to the unary message <strong>new</strong> by creating a new instance of themselves.
 For example,
</p>
<div class="code-example">
users &#x2190; Dictionary new
</div>
<p>
 sends the 'new' message to the Dictionary class which creates and returns back an instance of itself
 to be assigned to the variable users.
</p>

<p>
Note, that some Smalltalk classes could create instances in response to other messages.
 For example, the standard class Date responds to the message <strong>today</strong> with an instance
 representing the current day.
 In C# the same result could be achieved by using <strong>static property</strong> Today of the DateTime structure.
</p>
<div class="code-example">
DateTime thisDay = DateTime.Today;
</div>


<h3>Message in UML</h3>

<p>
Messages are intrinsic elements of UML 
 <a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/uml-25-diagrams.html#interaction-diagram" class="ref-link">interaction diagrams</a>.
 A <a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/interaction-message.html" class="ref-link">message</a>
 defines a specific kind of communication
 between <a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/sequence-diagrams.html#lifeline" class="ref-link">lifelines</a>
 of an interaction.
 A communication can be, for example, invoking an operation, replying back, creating or destroying an instance,
 raising a signal. It also specifies the sender and the receiver of the message.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/interaction-message.html#create" class="ref-link">Create message</a>
 is shown as a dashed line with open arrowhead, and pointing to the created lifeline's head.
</p> 

<div class="figure-left-80">
<img src="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/notation/sequence-message-create.png" width="220" height="144"
 alt="Online Bookshop creates Account." title="Online Bookshop creates Account." />
<p class="figure-text">
Online Bookshop creates Account.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Note, that this weird convention to send a message to a nonexisting object to create itself
 is used both in UML 1.x and 2.x.
 As we saw above, in Smalltalk-80 new objects are created by sending messages to <strong>classes</strong>,
 with instance of the class created and returned back.
 So one way to interpret UML create message notation is probably as a shortcut for these actions.
</p>


<!--
*****************
   Operation
******************
-->

<h2 id="operation">Operation and Method</h2>


<h3>Operation and Method in UML</h3>

<p>
<strong>Operation</strong> is defined in <strong>UML 1.4.2</strong> as a service that can be requested
 from an object to effect behavior. An operation has a <strong>signature</strong>,
 which may restrict the actual parameters that are possible.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Method</strong> is defined as the implementation of an operation.
 It specifies the algorithm or procedure associated with an operation.
</p>

<!--
*****************
   Encapsulation
******************
-->

<h2 id="encapsulation">Encapsulation</h2>

<p>
Encapsulation is one of the loosely defined OOAD concepts. The term is known in software development
 for many years but I can't find any reliable origin. Encapsulation was mentioned in the article 
 <a href="references.html#ref-clu-77" class="external-ref" 
  title="Barbara Liskov, et al., Abstraction Mechanisms in CLU.">[CLU 77]</a>
  describing <strong>abstraction</strong> mechanisms in programming language CLU in the context of
  <strong>hiding details of implementation</strong>.
</p>

<p>
CLU restricted access to the implementation by allowing to use only (public) cluster operations, i.e.
 public <strong>interface</strong>.
 It promoted design practices where abstractions are used to define and simplify the connections between
 system modules and to <strong>encapsulate</strong> implementation decisions that are likely to change.
</p>

<p>
If we look up the English word <strong>encapsulate</strong> in a dictionary, we will find two meanings:
 (1) to encase or become enclosed in a capsule (2) to express in a brief summary, epitomise.
 Both of these meanings of encapsulation seem appropriate in the context of OOAD.
</p>

<p>
Let's assume that the definition of encapsulation in OOAD is something like:
</p>

<div class="definition">
<strong>Encapsulation</strong> is a development technique which includes
<ul>
<li>creating new data types (<strong>classes</strong>) by combining both information (structure)
 and behaviors, and</li>
<li>restricting access to implementation details.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Encapsulation is very close or similar to
 the <a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/uml-object-oriented-concepts.html#abstraction" class="ref-link">abstraction</a> concept.
 The difference is probably in "direction" -
 encapsulation is more about hiding (encapsulating) implementation details
 while abstraction is about finding and exposing public interfaces.
 The two concepts are supported by access control.
</p>

<p>
 <strong>Access control</strong> allows both to hide implementation (<strong>implementation hiding</strong> or
 <strong>information hiding</strong>) and to expose public interface of a class.
</p>


<!--

 Encapsulation in UML
**********************

<h3>Encapsulation in UML</h3>

<p>
UML specifications provide no definition of <strong>encapsulation</strong> but use it loosely in several contexts.
</p>

<p>
For example, in UML 1.4
<strong>object</strong> is defined as an entity with a well defined boundary and identity that
 <strong>encapsulates</strong> state (attributes and relationships) and behavior
 (operations, methods, and state machines).
 Elements in peer packages are <strong>encapsulated</strong> and are not a priori <strong>visible</strong>
 to each other.
</p>

<p>
In UML 2.4 and 2.5 <span class="citation">a component represents a modular part of a system that encapsulates
 its contents and whose manifestation is replaceable within its environment</span>, and also
 <span class="citation">a Component is encapsulated and ... as a result, Components and subsystems
 can be flexibly reused and replaced by connecting ("wiring") them together</span>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/encapsulated-classifier.html" class="ref-link">Encapsulated classifier</a>
 in UML 2.4 and 2.5 is a structured classifier isolated from its environment (encapsulated ?) by using
 <a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/port.html" class="ref-link">ports</a>.
 Each port specifies a distinct interaction point between classifier and its environment.
</p>

<div class="figure-left-80">
<img src="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/composite-structure-diagrams/port-interfaces.png" width="260" height="108"
 alt="Library Services is classifier encapsulated through searchPort port."
 title="Library Services is classifier encapsulated through searchPort port." />
<p class="figure-text">
Library Services is classifier encapsulated through searchPort port.
</p>
</div>

<p>
UML 2.4 specification also used term <strong>completely encapsulated</strong>
 without providing any explanation. It was removed in UML 2.5.
</p>


<!--
*****************
   Abstraction
******************
-->

<h2 id="abstraction">Abstraction</h2>

<p>
There is no single commonly accepted definition of <strong>abstraction</strong> in OOD.
Some sources define abstraction as a way or mechanism to represent complex reality
 using simplified model. It could be also defined as a way to capture only those details
 about an object that are relevant to the current perspective.
 We can try to go back to origins - sometime in 70s - when programming languages CLU, Alphard, Modula-2, etc.
 introduced abstraction mechanisms.
</p>

<p>
Data abstractions in CLU were introduced with <strong>abstract data type</strong> construct
 called a <strong>cluster</strong>.
 Data abstractions required that the behavior of the data objects were
 completely characterized by the set of <strong>operations</strong>.
 Classical example is definition of stack cluster using only push and pop operations.
</p>

<p>
CLU also introduced separation of abstraction from its implementation(s):
</p>

<div class="definition">
An abstraction isolates use from implementation:
 an abstraction can be used without knowledge of its implementation and implemented
 without knowledge of its use.
</div>

<p>
Description unit of the cluster is <strong>interface specification</strong> of the abstraction.
 For the data abstractions it included the number and types of parameters, constraints on type parameters,
 and the name and interface specification of each operation.
 The <strong>implementation</strong> involved both selecting a representation for
 the data objects and implementing each cluster operation in terms of that data representation.
 Ultimately, there can be many implementations of an abstraction. Each implementation must satisfy
 the interface specification of the cluster.
</p>


<h3>Abstraction in UML</h3>

<p>
Abstraction in UML corresponds to the concept of abstraction in OOD (as described above).
 UML provides different types (subclasses) of abstraction, including realizations (i.e. implementations).
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/abstraction.html" class="ref-link">Abstraction</a> is 
 a <a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/dependency.html" class="ref-link">dependency relationship</a>
 that relates two elements or sets of elements (called <strong>client</strong> and <strong>supplier</strong>)
 representing the <strong>same concept</strong>
 but at <strong>different levels</strong> of abstraction or from <strong>different viewpoints</strong>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/realization.html" class="ref-link">Realization</a> is a specialized
 abstraction relationship between two sets of model elements, one representing a <strong>specification</strong>
(the <strong>supplier</strong>) and the other represents an <strong>implementation</strong> of the latter
 (the <strong>client</strong>).

   Inheritance
******************
-->

<h2 id="inheritance">Inheritance</h2>

<p>
In OOAD and in UML 1.4 <strong>inheritance</strong> is defined
  as a mechanism by which more specific classes
 (called <strong>subclasses</strong> or <strong>derived classes</strong>) incorporate
  structure and behavior of the more general classes
 (called <strong>superclasses</strong> or <strong>base classes</strong>).
</p>


<h3>Inheritance in UML 1.4</h3>

<p>
Glossary of the <strong>UML 1.4.2</strong> defines <strong>inheritance</strong> as
 <span class="citation">"the mechanism by which those more specific elements 
 incorporate structure and behavior of the more general elements"</span>.
 Inheritance supplements
 <a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/generalization.html" class="ref-link">generalization</a> relationship.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Generalization</strong> is defined as a taxonomic relationship between a more general element
 and a more specific element. The more specific element is fully consistent with the more general
 element and contains some additional information.
 An instance of the more specific element may be used where the more general element is allowed.
</p>

<p>
Inheritance was explained in <strong>UML 1.4.2</strong> using the concepts of a
 <strong>full descriptor</strong> and a <strong>segment descriptor</strong>.
A full descriptor contains a description of all of
 the attributes, associations, operations, and constraints that the object contains,
 and is usually implicit because it is built out of incremental segments combined together using inheritance.
</p>

<p class="citation">
In an object-oriented language, the description of an object is built out of incremental segments
 that are combined using inheritance to produce a full descriptor for an object.
 The segments are the modeling elements that are actually declared in a model.
 They include elements such as class and other generalizable elements.
 Each generalizable element contains a list of features and other
 relationships that it adds to what it inherits from its ancestors.
 </p>
 
<p class="citation">
Each kind of generalizable element has a set of inheritable features.
 For any model element, these include constraints.
 For classifiers, these include features ( attributes, operations, signal receptions, and methods)
 and participation in associations.
 [<a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/references.html#ref-uml-142" class="external-ref" title="UML 1.4.2 Specification">UML 1.4.2 Specification</a>]
</p>

<p>
If a generalizable element has more than one parent (<strong>multiple inheritance</strong>),
 then its full descriptor contains the union of the features from its own segment descriptor and the
 segment descriptors of all of its ancestors.
</p>

<p>
Attributes in UML 1.4 could not be
 <a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/redefining-property.html" class="ref-link">redefined</a>
 but a method may be declared in more than one subclass.
 A method declared in any segment supersedes and replaces a method with the same signature declared in
any ancestor.
</p>


<h3>Inheritance in UML 2.x</h3>

<p>
<strong>UML 2.4</strong> and the newest <strong>UML 2.5</strong> specifications provide no definition
 for <strong>inheritance</strong>.
 UML 2.x specifications say that with generalization specializing classifier <strong>inherits</strong>
 <a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/uml-core.html#feature" class="ref-link">features</a>
 of the more general classifier.
 Any <a href="https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class.html#constraint" class="ref-link">constraint</a>
 applying to instances of the general classifier also applies to instances of the specific classifier.
</p>

<p>
<strong>UML 2.5</strong> provides some vague and incomplete explanation of how <strong>inheritance</strong>
 works in UML:
</p>

<p class="citation"> 
When a Classifier is generalized, certain members of its generalizations are inherited,
 that is they behave as though they were defined in the inheriting Classifier itself.
 For example, an inherited member that is an attribute has a value or collection of values
 in any instance of the inheriting Classifier, and an inherited member that is an Operation
 may be invoked on an instance of the inheriting Classifier.

*****************
  Polymorphism
******************
-->

<h2 id="polymorphism">Polymorphism</h2>

<p>
As it is usual with other OOAD concepts, <strong>polymorphism</strong> is also poorly defined.
You can find all kinds of strange definitions of polymorphism, and there is no agreement which one is the best.
To make things even worse, I will add my own definition of polymorphism:
</p>

<div class="definition">
Polymorphism is ability to apply different meaning (semantics, implementation)
 to the same symbol (message, operation) in different contexts. 
</div>

<p>
When context is defined at compile time, it is called <strong>static</strong> or 
<strong>compile-time polymorphism</strong>. When context is defined during program execution,
it is <strong>dynamic</strong> or <strong>run-time polymorphism</strong>.
</p>

<p>
It is believed that term "polymorphism" was introduced by Strachey in 1967
 <a href="references.html#ref-cs-67" class="external-ref" 
 title="C. Strachey, Fundamental concepts in programming languages.">[CS 67]</a>
 to describe operations and functions that could be applied to more than one type of arguments.
</p>

<p>
A typical example of static "ad hoc" polymorphism in procedural languages like ALGOL-60 or ALGOL-68 is:
</p>
<div class="code-example">
sum := x + y;
</div>
<p>
In this example "+" is <strong>polymorphic operation</strong> which could be used with different types of operands -
 integer, real, string, complex, vector, etc. Specific static context - types of operands x and y -
 will determine at compile time which implementation of "+" is to be used.
</p>

<p>
This kind of static polymorphism is usually called <strong>overloading</strong> and means
 using the same operation symbol or function name on different types.
 Note, that overloading also allows different number of parameters
 and sometimes (ALGOL-68) even different priorities.
</p>

<p>
Another kind of static polymorphism is <strong>parametric polymorphism</strong>
 <a href="references.html#ref-bstr-cpp" class="external-ref" title="B. Stroustrup, The C++ Programming Language.">[BSC 77]</a>
 and is based on <strong>templates</strong>. In C++ example below, Vector template defines
 generic method 'elem' and operator '[ ]':
</p>
<div class="code-example">
template&lt;class T&gt; class Vector {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;T* v;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;int size;<br />
public:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Vector();<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Vector(int);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;T&amp; elem(int i) { return v[i]; }<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;T&amp; operator[] (int i);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;/* ... */<br />
};<br />
Vector&lt;int&gt; vi;<br />
Vector&lt;Shape*&gt; vps;<br />
</div>

<p>
In OOAD <strong>polymorphism</strong> means <strong>dynamic polymorphism</strong> and
 is commonly related to as <strong>late binding</strong> or <strong>dynamic binding</strong>.
 It could be defined as:
</p>

<div class="definition">
(Dynamic) Polymorphism is ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same message
 in a different way.
</div>


<h3>Virtual Functions</h3>

<p>
Procedural language Algol-60 allowed to pass a procedure as a parameter to another procedure.
 In Simula 67 
 classes may, like procedures, have formal parameters but they did not allow procedures as
 parameters to classes. Simula 67 authors found another way to have the same statements to have slightly different
 effect in different objects 
 <a href="references.html#ref-sk-03" class="external-ref" title="Stein Krogdahl. The birth of Simula.">[SK 03]</a>
 <span class="citation">by declaring a procedure in a class C as "virtual", it could be redefined (overridden)
 in a subclass D. ... Thus, the same procedure call could activate different “versions” of the procedure,
 at least in objects of different subclasses.</span>
</p>


<p>
Dynamic binding mechanism in C++, Java, C# allows to determine behavior (implementation) to be invoked
 in response to the message received by a specific object.
 To get this kind of polymorphic behavior in C++, the member functions must be <strong>virtual</strong>
 and objects must be manipulated through pointers or references
 <a href="references.html#ref-bstr-cpp" class="external-ref" title="B. Stroustrup, The C++ Programming Language.">[BSC 77]</a>.
</p>

<h3>Polymorphism in UML</h3>

<p>
There is no definition of polymorphism in UML specifications but there are some differences
 in how this term is used in different versions of UML.
</p>

<p>
In <strong>UML 1.4.2</strong> operation declares whether or not it may be realized
 by a different method in a subclass (which looks very similar to virtual functions in C++)
 by using <strong>isPolymorphic</strong> attribute. 
 Methods realizing polymorphic operation have the same signature as the operation and have a body implementing
 the specification of the operation.
 Methods in descendants override and replace methods inherited from ancestors.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>isPolymorphic</strong> attribute is no longer present in <strong>UML 2.4</strong> and
 <strong>UML 2.5</strong>, without any explanation.
 Does it mean that all operations are now polymorphic (virtual), as if inspired by Java language?
 The <strong>UML 2.4.1</strong> specification had one obscure statement mentioning <strong>polymorphism</strong>
 in Chapter 11, Actions, and this statement is now removed from <strong>UML 2.5</strong>:
</p>

<p class="citation">
Operations are specified in the model and can be dynamically selected only through polymorphism.
</p>

<p>
I remember long time ago, Pascal language was promoted fiercely as a significant simplification
 compared to the huge, too formal, and complex Algol-68.
 The result was plain, restrained, and poorly defined language with ambiguous semantics.
 Hope, UML 2.5 simplification effort will not end up the same way, simple is not always lucid.
